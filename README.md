# EMVportfolio

This R package solves the Exploratory Mean-Variance (EMV) portfolio optimization problem. 

## Package Architecture
All the functions of this package are written in R and stored in folder [R](https://github.com/MaxGniluynehc/EMVportfolio/tree/main/R), in particular, 
* [act_EMV_policy](https://github.com/MaxGniluynehc/EMVportfolio/blob/main/R/act_EMV_policy.R) and [act_MLE_policy](https://github.com/MaxGniluynehc/EMVportfolio/blob/main/R/act_MLE_policy.R) make investment decisions (i.e., take actions) following the MLE-based or RL-based trading policy, given the market scenario.  
* [getStockPath](https://github.com/MaxGniluynehc/EMVportfolio/blob/main/R/getStockPath.R) simulates the stock price paths from a Geometric Brownian Motion. 
* [getTerminalWealth](https://github.com/MaxGniluynehc/EMVportfolio/blob/main/R/getTerminalWealth.R) make the investments and compute the terminal wealth, following different trading policies.
* [show_terminalwealth](https://github.com/MaxGniluynehc/EMVportfolio/blob/main/R/show_terminalwealth.R) visualizes the trading performance of different polices, via plots and tables.
* [trainRLalg](https://github.com/MaxGniluynehc/EMVportfolio/blob/main/R/trainRLalg.R) trains the RL algorithm for the EMV trading policy. It can also visualize the training process via plots.

## Final Report
* [Final report](https://github.com/MaxGniluynehc/EMVportfolio/blob/main/STAT900_final_project_YulingMaxChen.pdf) is the final report submitted to the STAT900 committee for evaluation. Any unclear definition, problem setup and simulation details in the Pacakge documentation can be found in the final report.
