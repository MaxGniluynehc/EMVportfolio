Description: This package solves the Exploratory Mean-Variance (EMV) portfolio optimization problem
    for the optimal exploratory policy. The EMV optimal policy is parameterized and learned by training 
    a Reinforcement Learning model. Upon convergence, it will stick on to the optimal policy and make 
    investment decisions in a naive market with one stock (risky asset) and one bond (riskfree asset).
    This package can also make investment following the classical (non-exploratory) policy, using Maximum
    Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Hence, we can solve the simple research question "Does the RL-based EMV 
    optimal exploratory policy increases mean and reduces standard-deviation of the distribution of 
    terminal wealth, compared to the MLE-based optimal classical policy?"
